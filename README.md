# FDNS Object Microservice

This repository contains the Object layer for the Data Lake. This is the mutable layer of the data lake.

## Running locally

Please read the following instructions carefully for information on how to build, run and test this microservice in your local environment.

### Before you start

You will need to have the following installed before getting up and running locally:

- Docker, [Installation guides](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- Docker Compose, [Installation guides](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- **Windows Users**: This project uses `Make`, please see [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) for running commands in this README

### Build

First you'll need to build the image, to do so just run the following command:

```sh
make docker-build
```

### Run

Now you'll be able to run the image, you can easily do so by running the following command:

```sh
make docker-run
```

### Test

To check if the microservice is running, just open the following URL in your browser:

### MongoDB Configuration

First, you need to configure these environment variables using Docker or the STS Launch Configuration:

- `OBJECT_MONGO_HOST`: This is the host for your MongoDB server
- `OBJECT_MONGO_PORT`: This is the port for your MongoDB server
- `OBJECT_MONGO_USER_DATABASE`: Contains where the user name and password are stored in MongoDB, by default it's `admin`
- `OBJECT_MONGO_USERNAME`: The user name that you want to use to authenticate
- `OBJECT_MONGO_PASSWORD`: The password that you want to use to authenticate

Be sure, that you have properly configured your MongoDB server. If you use the `docker-compose.yml` file in this project, after starting Mongo, you need to:

Login to the MongoDB server (in this case, we connect to the `admin` database):

```sh
docker exec -it fdns-ms-object_mongo_1 mongo admin
```

And create the user:

```sh
db.createUser({ user: 'admin', pwd: 'admin', roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ] });
```

Exit the console, by typing:

```sh
exit
```

### OAuth 2 Configuration

This microservice is configurable to be secured with an OAuth 2 provider.

__Scopes__: This application uses the following scope: `object.database.collection`

Please see the following environment variables for configuring with your OAuth 2 provider:

- `OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI`: This is the introspection URL of your provider, ex: `https://hydra:4444/oauth2/introspect`
- `OAUTH2_PROTECTED_URIS`: This is a path for which routes are to be restricted, ex: `/api/1.0/**`
- `OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID`: This is your OAuth 2 client id with the provider
- `OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET`: This is your OAuth 2 client secret with the provider
- `SSL_VERIFYING_DISABLE`: This is an option to disable SSL verification, you can disable this when testing locally but this should be set to `false` for all production systems

### Miscellaneous Configurations

Here are other various configurations and their purposes:

- `OBJECT_PORT`: This is a configurable port the application is set to run on
- `OBJECT_FLUENTD_HOST`: This is the host of your [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/)
- `OBJECT_FLUENTD_PORT`: This is the port of your [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/)
- `OBJECT_PROXY_HOSTNAME`: This is the hostname of your environment for use with Swagger UI, ex: `api.my.org`
- `OBJECT_IMMUTABLE`: This is a `;` separated list of collections which are immutable collections
